# fastICA_EMG_decomp
Matlab implementation of FastICA approach for hdEMG decomposition, presented in the Hyser dataset paper. This repository is only a reference to the original code-base available at the [physionet dataset](https://physionet.org/content/hd-semg/1.0.0/). This repository is not actively maintained.

I recently refactored this toolbox and improved its performance, transparency, and readability in the [hdEMG-decomposition repository](https://github.com/neuromechanist/hdEMG-Decomposition).
There are also a reach read me, function documentation, and sample data included in the new implementation.
